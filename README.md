# HueFocus - Real Time Colour Identification System

This is a project I made with my team during a 16-hour hackathon. It is a colour identification system which captures live video data from the webcam of the computer and detects various colours instantaneously. The user can also take a snapshot of the screen showing the identified colours.
This project primarily uses ComputerVision (CV) techniques, with the following tech stack:

OpenCV module : for webcam access and image
processing
NumPy : for numeric processing and extracting HSV values
of specific pixels
Streamlit Python framework : for UI/UX

The keyboard controls are as follows:
'r' key : to start/restart
's' key : to take a snapshot
'q' key : to quit
